# COS214_Project
There will be a project that needs to be completed before the end of the semester. The project specification will be made available late October. It will require you to design, model and develop a medium sized system in preparation for COS 301. This will be a group-based effort, no individuals may attempt the project. Your team needs to demonstrate your project before the end of the semester. As with assignments, no late submissions will be accepted. There will also be no Aegrotat project demonstrations if all members of the team fail to demonstrate the project before the demonstration cut-off according the to project submission rules.
